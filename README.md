# THE PUZZLE EXCHANGE

## Author
Cara McAvinchey 

## Project Overview
- The Puzzle Exchange is a website that hopes to connect people who enjoy the simple pleasure of building a puzzle with friends and wish to exchange the sets they are no longer building with something new.
- Each month members meet up at a local coffee shop in Cape Town, South Africa and exchange their puzzle sets with each other to take home or simply meetup and join in on a puzzle build for the afternoon.
- This group is useful for anyone looking to socialise, relax and enjoy a hobby they have in common together.
- The users of this website will be able to find all the information they need to join the exchange club including monthly meet up times, locations and a sign up form.

## UX

### PROJECT GOAL
* The project is aimed at providing a way for people who enjoy building puzzles as a hobby to connect with each other.
* Inspired by the concept of a bookclub, members can join the exchange to borrow and swop their puzzles instead of purchasing new sets.

### USER STORIES
1. As a first time visitor,
    * I want to learn more about the Puzzle Exchange and what the group is all about.
    * I want to investigate the meet up locations, times and how to sign up as a member.
    * I want to find the social media links to see their following and to look at photos from past meet ups.

2. As a returning visitor,
    * I want to find out where the next meet up location will be for the month.
    * I want to contact the organisers about the exchange process.
    * I want to sign up as a new member after considering my decision.

3. As a frequent user, 
    * I want to check to see if there are any new meet up locations for the month.
    * I want to contact the organisers about borrowing, returning or add a new puzzle to the exchange or general queries.       

### USER PROFILES

1. Grace would like to meet new friends, but she doesn’t have any puzzles to exchange at the moment. She likes the idea of connecting with new people over a coffee and a puzzle for the afternoon. 

2. Gavin enjoys purchasing new puzzles and completing them during his weekends. He has finished building all of his sets and would like something new. Instead of purchasing more, he meets up with the exchange club each month to swop his sets with another member.
 
## DESIGN CHOICES

### Colors
- The hero image of a white puzzle piece on a yellow background inspired the color palette of the website. The headings and body text are dark grey to ensure clear contrast and readability for the user.
- Yellow is a bright and optimistic color which links to the purpose of the group being to connect and make friends.

### Typography
- The logo and headings use Roboto Condensed and body text uses Lato with a fall-back font of san-serif. 
- The choice of Roboto Condensed and Lato were selected using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Lato|Roboto+Condensed:wght@700). 
- The headings descrease in size to ensure full responsiveness of the website.

### Images
- The home page has an overhead shot of a puzzle piece on a yellow background sourced from [Pexel](https://www.pexels.com).
- This image inspired the color and typography choices of the website. First time visitors will understand the theme of the page from the logo and image choice.
- The icons chosen for headings linked to the content being introduced sourced from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Animations
- The home and locations page images have a subtle zoom effect when users load the page to add some depth and interest to the website.

### Responsivness
- The website was designed using flexbox instead of float or grid to avoid fixed heights and ensure responsiveness throughout the website.
