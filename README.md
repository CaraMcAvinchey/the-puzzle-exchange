# THE PUZZLE EXCHANGE

## Author

## Project Overview
- The Puzzle Exchange is a website that hopes to connect people who enjoy the simple pleasure of building a puzzle with friends and wish to exchange the sets they are no longer building with something new.
- Each month members meet up at a local coffee shop in Cape Town, South Africa and exchange their puzzle sets with each other to take home or simply meetup and join in on a puzzle build for the afternoon.
- Puzzle Club is useful for anyone looking to socialise, relax and enjoy a cup of coffee whilst enjoying a hobby together.
- The users of this website will be able to find all the information they need about the group to join the exchange club including monthly meet up times, locations and a sign up form.

### USER PROFILES

1. Grace would like to meet new friends, but she doesnâ€™t have any puzzles to exchange at the moment. She likes the idea of connecting with new people over a coffee and a puzzle for the afternoon. 

2. Gavin enjoys purchasing new puzzles and completing them during his weekends. He has finished building all of his sets and would like something new. Instead of purchasing more, he meets up with the exchange club each month to swop his sets with another member.
