## Project Overview
- The Puzzle Exchange is a website that hopes to connect people who enjoy the simple pleasure of building a puzzle with friends and wish to exchange the sets they are no longer building with something new.
- Each month members can meet up at a local coffee shop in Cape Town, South Africa and exchange their puzzle sets with each other to take home or simply meetup and join in on a puzzle build for the afternoon.
- Puzzle Club is useful for anyone looking to socialise, relax and enjoy a cup of coffee whilst sharing the joy of a common interest.
- The users of this website will be able to find all the information they need about the group to join the exchange club including monthly meet up times, locations and a sign up form.
